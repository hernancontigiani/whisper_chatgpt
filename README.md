# whisper_chatgpt

- Download a video mp4, rename as "video.mp4"
- Run "transcript.py"
  - This will output a .wav file (only once) and a transcription file in "transcription.txt"
 - Run "process_transcription.py"
  - This will output a txt file "chatgpt_msg.txt" to send to CHatGPT (copy that content into the chat)
  
 Enjoy!
